# Better Commits Scripts
This is a collection of scripts to support the creation of a narrative, easier to read commit history. See [the Better Commits blog post series][blog-series] to learn more about this topic.

## [commit-format.sh](commit-format.sh)
Supports you in formatting a series of commits and committing these format changes separately. Read more about this script in [Better Commits - Part 4 - Code Format Reloaded][].

## [commit-refactoring.py](commit-refactoring.py)

This script eases committing code refactorings separately, while keeping local changes intact, when using Git for source code management. Read more about the script in [Better Commits - Part 2 - Refactorings][].
